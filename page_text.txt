The 
alpine marmot
 (
Marmota marmota
) is a large 
ground-dwelling squirrel
, from the 
genus
 of 
marmots
. It is found in high numbers in mountainous areas of central and southern Europe,
[
2
]
 at heights between 800 and 3,200 m (2,600–10,500 ft) in the 
Alps
, 
Carpathians
, 
Tatras
 and Northern 
Apennines
. In 1948 they were reintroduced with success in the 
Pyrenees
, where the alpine marmot had disappeared at end of the 
Pleistocene
 epoch.
[

Evolution
[
edit
]


Reconstruction of the 
phylogenetic
 tree of 
Rodentia
 on the basis of their whole 
genomes


The Alpine marmot genome is characterized by remarkably low 
heterozygosity
 at the genome level, as compared to other species known for low levels of heterozygosity


The alpine marmot originates as an animal of 
Pleistocene
 cold steppe, exquisitely adapted to this ice-age climate. As such, alpine marmots are excellent diggers, able to penetrate 
soil
 that even a 
pickaxe
 would have difficulty with, and spend up to nine months per year in 
hibernation
.
[
4
]


Since the disappearance of the Pleistocene cold steppe, the alpine marmot persists in the high altitude alpine meadow. During the colonisation of Alpine habitat, the alpine marmot has lost most of its genetic diversity through a 
bottleneck effect
. It could not rebuild its genetic diversity ever since, as its lifestyle adapted to the Ice Age climate slowed its rate of genomic evolution.
[
5
]
 The alpine marmot is indeed one of the least genetically diverse wild-living animals.

Description
[
edit
]


An adult alpine marmot is between 43 and 73 cm (17–29 in) in head-and-body length and the tail measures from 13 to 20 cm (5–8 in). The body mass ranges from 1.9 to 8 kg (4.2–17.6 lb), with the animals being significantly lighter in the spring (just after hibernation) than in the autumn (just before hibernation).
[
6
]
[
7
]
 The alpine marmot is sometimes considered the heaviest 
squirrel
 species, although some other marmot species have a similar weight range, making it unclear exactly which is the largest.
[
6
]
[
7
]
[
8
]
 Its coat is a mixture of blonde, reddish and dark gray fur. While most of the alpine marmot's fingers have claws, its thumbs have nails.



Range and ecology
[
edit
]


As its name suggests, the alpine marmot ranges throughout the European 
Alps
, ranging through alpine areas of France, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Slovenia, Slovakia and Austria. They have also been introduced elsewhere with sub-populations in the 
Pyrenees
, France's 
Massif Central
, 
Jura
, 
Vosges
, 
Black Forest
, 
Apennine Mountains
, and the 
Romanian Carpathians
. The 
Tatra marmot
 (
Marmota marmota latirostris
 Kratochvíl, 1961) represents an endemic subspecies of Alpine marmot that originated during the Quaternary period. Tatra marmots inhabit Tatry Mountains and Nízke Tatry Mountains.
Marmots are abundant in their core population; in the Romanian Carpathians, for example, the population is estimated at 1,500 individuals.
[
1
]
 Alpine marmots prefer 
alpine meadows
 and high-altitude pastures, where colonies live in deep burrow systems situated in 
alluvial soil
 or rocky areas.
[
9
]


Marmots may be seen "sun bathing", but actually this is often on a flat rock and it is believed they are actually cooling, possibly to deal with parasites. Marmots are temperature sensitive and an increase in temperature can cause habitat loss for the species as a whole.
[
10
]




Diet
[
edit
]


Alpine marmots eat plants such as 
grasses
 and 
herbs
, as well as grain, 
insects
, 
spiders
 and 
worms
. They prefer young and tender plants over any other kind, and hold food in their forepaws while eating. They mainly emerge from their 
burrows
 to engage in 
feeding
 during the morning and afternoon, as they are not well suited to 
heat
, which may result in them not feeding at all on very warm days. When the weather is suitable, they will consume large amounts of food in order to create a layer of 
fat
 on their body, enabling them to survive their long 
hibernation
 period.

Lifestyle
[
edit

Alarm call of an Alpine marmot. Savoie, French Alps.


When creating a 
burrow
, they use both their forepaws and hind feet to assist in the work—the forepaws scrape away the 
soil
, which is then pushed out of the way by the hind feet. If there are any 
stones
 in the way, the alpine marmot will remove them with its 
teeth
 provided that the stones aren't too large. "Living areas" are created at the end of a burrow, and are often lined with dried 
hay
, 
grass
 and 
plant stems
. Any other burrow tunnels that go nowhere are used as 
toilet
 areas. Once burrows have been completed, they only host one family. They are often enlarged by the next 
generation
, sometimes creating very complex burrows over time. Each alpine marmot will live in a group that consists of several burrows, and which has a dominant breeding pair. Alpine marmots are very defensive against intruders, and will warn them off using intimidating behavior, such as beating of the tail and chattering of the teeth, and by marking their territory with their scent. One can often see an alpine marmot "standing" while they keep a look-out for potential 
predators
 or other dangers. Warnings are given, by emitting a series of loud whistles, after which members of the colony may be seen running for cover.

The 
mating season
 for alpine marmots occurs in the spring, right after their hibernation period comes to a close, which gives their 
offspring
 the highest possible chance of storing enough fat to 
survive
 the coming winter. Alpine marmots are able to 
breed
 once they reach an age of two years. Dominant females tend to suppress reproduction of subordinates by being antagonistic towards them while they are pregnant which causes stress and kills the young.
[
11
]
 Once the female is 
pregnant
, she will take bedding materials (such as grass) into the burrow for when she gives 
birth
 after a 
gestation
 period of 33–34 days. Each 
litter
 consists of between one and seven 
babies
, though this number is usually three. The babies are born 
blind
 and will grow dark 
fur
 within several days. The 
weaning
 period takes a further forty days, during which time the mother will leave the young in the burrow while she searches for food. After this period, the offspring will come out of the burrow and search for solid food themselves. Their fur becomes the same colour as adult alpine marmots by the end of the summer, and after two years they will have reached their full size. If kept in 
captivity
, alpine marmots can live up to 15–18 years.

Introduced alpine marmots in the Pyrenees


Hibernation
[
edit
]


Alpine marmots survive extreme changes in weather and food shortages during winter by hibernating.
[
12
]
 As the summer begins to end, alpine marmots will gather old stems in their burrows in order to serve as 
bedding
 for their impending hibernation, which can start as early as October. They seal the burrow with a combination of 
earth
 and their own 
faeces
. Once winter arrives, alpine marmots will huddle next to each other and begin hibernation, a process which lowers their 
heart rate
 to five beats per minute and 
breathing
 to 1–3 breaths per minute. Huddling next to nestmates allows for passive heat exchange and larger hibernating groups result in increased survivability.
[
13
]
 During hibernation their stored fat supplies are used slowly, which usually allows them to survive the winter. Their 
body temperature
 will drop to almost the same as the air around them, although their heart and breathing rates will speed up if the environment approaches 
freezing point
. Some alpine marmots will 
starve
 to death due to their layers of fat running out; this is most likely to happen in younger individuals.
[

]




Interaction with humans
[
edit
]


Rendered
 marmot fat


Alpine marmots were once widely hunted for food and because their fat is believed to ease 
rheumatism
 when rubbed on the 
skin
. Hunting of the alpine marmot still occurs for 
sport
 as well as for its fat. Hunting is a danger to the species if insufficiently regulated, as they reproduce relatively slowly.
[
4
]

In general the alpine marmot is currently not in danger of extinction, but certain sub-populations of marmot may be threatened such as those in the 
Jura
 and in Germany.
[
1
]
 A population in 
Rodna
 (Romania) is very small and threatened by poaching.

Drouais, François-Hubert - The Children of the Duc de Bouillon - 1756


The use of trained alpine marmots by itinerants from 
Savoy
 was a not uncommon occurrence in the late 18th century.
[
15
]
 The marmot would be kept in a small box while in transit, and during a performance, the marmot would dance to the playing of an instrument, such as a 
hurdy-gurdy
.
[
16
]
 Marmots became associated with the people of Savoy, and their style of dress, and the image of a traveling Savoyard with a marmot was captured in art, such as in 
François-Hubert Drouais
' painting 
The Children of the Duke of Bouillon dressed as Montagnards
, and in 
Ludwig van Beethoven
's composition, 
Marmotte
.
